# Fancy
A strawman implementation of the [Fantasy Land](https://github.com/pufuwozu/fantasy-land) spec for idomatic algebraic structures in JavaScript

I don't really know what I'm doing when it comes to algebraic abstractions in programming. By attempting to implement the spec, I hope I can improve it with clarifications and test suite coverage, adversarial pair programming style.

Once this gets further, I hope to put up something more useful at this module name.

## Fant'sy
Quoth [wiktionary](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/fancy):
> Fancy - From Middle English, a contraction of fantasy, from Old French fantasie, from Medieval Latin fantasia, from Late Latin phantasia (“an idea, notion, fancy, phantasm”), from Ancient Greek  (phantazein, “to render visible”)
